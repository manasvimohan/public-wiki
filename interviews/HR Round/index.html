<p>Any form of conflict can hinder a team from moving forward and reaching its full potential, so I always take actions to stop it quickly.</p>
<p>Some people would ask their managers to take care of the conflict, but i believe all team members should take responsibility for it as mature and professional adults.</p>
<p>I would check my actions to make sure I was not contributing to the conflict before speaking to the other person in private to find an amicable compromise we were both comfortable with that benefited the team.</p>

<p>Whilst I genuinely believe I am worth the higher salary range I appreciate you do not know me, and I need to prove to you my worth.</p>
<p>On that basis, I would be comfortable with a salary of $120,000, and I believe you will see a positive return on your investment at that amount.</p>

<p>Example - 
The three words I would used to describe myself as <em>, _ and </em>.</p>
<p>I am industrious because I am hard working, I will take responsibility for everything within my remit, and I will seeks ways to quickly overcome challenges, as and when they arise. </p>
<p>I am diligent, which means I will always work quickly and accurately with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>I am resilient because I never get stressed in difficult situations and I can prioritize multiple tasks regardless of how many I have.</p>
<p>I am trustworthy, which means you can rely on me to do everything I am supposed to do, at required standards, I will act professionally whilst communicating with external and internal stakeholders and I will always be supportive co-worker in my team.</p>
<p>I am knowledgable because I have the applicable academic qualification and years of experience in several similar roles</p>
<p>I am adaptable because I am a type of person who will caryy out duties outside of my job dexcription and I am willingly help out your business at short notice, as and when needed, for example If you need me to work extra hours or duties, I will always do that, and I will be prepared to cover the work of co-workers who are of work sick.</p>
<p>Result Driven. In my last role, my manager always praised me for the amount of work I completed and how I came up with innovative and out of the box solutions.</p>
<p>I am a naturally trustworthy person. I can be trusted to complete my tasks on time and to expected standards, I can be trusted to follow the company rules and procedures and I can be trusted to represent the company in a psotive manner when communicating with external people, like contractors for example.</p>
<p>I am self-motivated, which means I take upon myself to find extra work to do, if things are ever quite and I will always seek ways to help your business be more efficient and help you save money too.</p>
