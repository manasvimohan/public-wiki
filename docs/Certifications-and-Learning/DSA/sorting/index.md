# Sorting

01-Bubble       - O(n^2)        - Stable
02-Selection
03-Insertion    - O(n^2)        - Stable - Suitable for linked list - use if n<15
04-Merge        - O(n log n)    - Stable - Suitable for linked list - use if n>=15
05-Quick
06-Counting
07-Bucket

Stable means that when sorting is done, the duplicates in list maintain their order of location
Eg. [2,3,1,4,5,6,4,8,7] - Sorted to [1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7,8] <- here 1st 4 is on left and 2nd 4 on right.
