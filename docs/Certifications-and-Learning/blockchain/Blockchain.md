# Tokenisation

1. When we tokenise under #STO, what are the requirements to be get under regulations of different countires. What does getting under regulations mean. 
2. How exactly STO different from #ICO
3. When we speak about real world asset backed tokens, how does the price of that token remain in sync with the real world prices. 
	1. Example, we have **USDT**, which is backed by USD; in this case we have world markets (which have large volumes and are recognised) to refer our prices and set a smart contract to remain in sync with the real asset. 
	2. Second example, in case of **#KlimaDAO**, which it is linked to Verra Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) https://verra.org/ (via https://toucan.earth/) which is kind of a standard, from which prices can be referred and smart contracts can do the processing of burning and creation to keep price in line with real asset. How can a real estate property, who's price can not be verified by a recognised central agency or by a market with high volumes like a forex or stock market, how does the token price remain in sync with the real price; consider low volumes, how does the volitily controlled.
5. If we do not list tokens on a secondary market, and basically control the price of asset, how to we ensure our investors that our prices are actual and without bias.
6. If we basically raise money in fiat currencies, and only provide tokens, and do not raise money in crypto, how do we convince the investors that we are legit. For example, all cryptos can be exchanged and converted into other crypto currencies; if we raise investments in terms of fiat, and do not list our token on any DEX, and nor treat them as standard NFT (while we do upload the records on chain); how will the mechanism work.


# Metaverse #metaverse
1. We need to generate a quantitative way measure the quality of a land on any metaverse project; like a check list with weighted averages, which when applied to any piece of space in metaverse, gives out a scrore. We need to work on this checklist.
2. We also need a qualitative way to select the metaverse platform itself, which vary widely in terms of audiance, usage and purpose. Example, sandbox allowes creating your own games and provide the tools, while decentraland is more of a minecraft style playing game.
3. Before finalising the metaverse platform, we need to understand our business motive, since the developers for each platforms are different and comes in different rates, platform like sandbox might need a voxel 3d artist since they ahve there own proprietary platform to make characters, game developers etc while decentraland we need a normal 3d artist since it allows a lot more types of experiances to be created.
4. Since, tokens can be backed by a real estate asset, how can we create a digital asset on a metaverse and backit up with real world asset. (If we wish to do it). 
	1. Example, I will to make exact digital replica of our mall in metaverse, and provide each shop on the platform, and each shops have NFT to be sold, and I wish to link the price of those NFTs with a real world asset, the NFTs can be used to exchange for real goods in the shop (similar to stockx has done with nike sneakers https://stockx.com/ ). 
	2. We provide this facility to all our shops for free as welcome gift.
