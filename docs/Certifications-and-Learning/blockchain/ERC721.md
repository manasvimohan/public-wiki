# ERC721
ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique.

# Constructing an ERC721 Token Contract
Weâ€™ll use ERC721 to track items in our game, which will each have their own unique attributes. Whenever one is to be awarded to a player, it will be minted and sent to them. Players are free to keep their token or trade it with other people as they see fit, as they would any other asset on the blockchain! Please note any account can call awardItem to mint items. To restrict what accounts can mint items we can add Access Control.
