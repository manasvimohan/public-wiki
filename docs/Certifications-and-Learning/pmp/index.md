Application of knoledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities

# What is a project
A temporary endevour undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. It has beginning and end always!

# Six Constrains in project magagement

Scope
Time
Cost
Quality
Risk 
Resource

# Project Life Cycle

Initiation
[Planning](Planning.md)
Execution
Monitoring (lot of communication)
Closure (what worked, what did not, send resources to other projects etc etc)

# Earned Value Management 2-4 questions

In the middle of the project, we need to monitor performance and forecast what will happen, so we used EVM metrics

NOTE all Values are in Currency, except for Indexes, which are CPI, SPI and TCPI

Simple Explanation - https://youtu.be/0pY4sxQe7sU?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFK6X0Hu8jmcXZo-8UztOPi4&t=317
Detailed Explanation - https://youtu.be/rWo-Aucnozc?list=PLdC3YQR4lNFK6X0Hu8jmcXZo-8UztOPi4&t=146


1. BAC Budget at completion - Original budget that we thought, let it be $100

2. PV Planned Value - Gives Cost - At any time, how much % work should have been completed and Multiply it by BAC. Example 10 days to complete, in the 7th day, actual work needed was 7/10. So PV is 0.7*100, ie $70

3. EV Earned Value - Gives Cost - At any time, actual % work done * BAC. So if actual work done 80%, so EV becomes 0.8*100 ie $80

4. AC Actual Cost - Cost - Money spent till now. Say it is $60 (Note that in the 7th day, BAC allows to spend $70, common sense, 10 total days, each day $10, so 7th should be $70, but we spent $60; which is cool. Issue is, we must know if we spent $60 and not done work, or $60 done more work. Hence we need to compare it with EV, which is actual work done wrt cost. Hence we move to CV and CPI)

Cost Measure
5. CV Cost Variance - EV - AC --> Tells how good we doing, 80-60 = $20 means we saving $20 at that time!

6. CPI Cost Performance Index - EV/AC -> Logical, so 80/60 = 1.3 <-- means we are saving cost! Below 1 is spending more. At 1 is exact. So for every $ spent, we are getting $1.3 worth of work done, which is good. We can also say we are 1.3-1, 0.3 --> 30% under budget (which is good)

Time Measure
7. SV Schedule Variance - EV -PV --> 80-70 = $10. CV CPI gave us view in terms of cost, but what about time? Here comes SV. Here $10 tells that our work is ahead of schedule by $10, -ve value means behind the schedule

8. SPI Schedule Performance Index - EV/PV --> 80/70= 1.14. Means we are ahead of schedule! 1 means exactly on schedule and below 1 means LATE! We can say in our case that we are ahead of schedule by 14%, below 1, say 0.9 we will say we are behind schedule by 10%

Other Measure
9. EAC Estimate At Completion - BAC/ CPI - 100/1.3 = $ 76.92. This means that considering the current pace and spent, the project will complete in $76.92, which is good as our BAC was $100, so you saving a lot, like $23 which is VAC, which is 23/100 = 23% saving 

10. ETC Estimate To Completion - EAC - AC - 76.92-60 = 16.92 --> This means we only need $16.92 more to complete our work.

11. VAC Variance at Completion - BAC - EAC - 100-76.92 = 23 <-- Means we save $23 on our project, we had budget of 100 and our estimates say, if we go by current pace, we will save $23 which is AWESOME!

12. TCPI To-Complete Performance Index - (BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC) - (100-80)/(100-60) = 0.5 <-- This means we only have to put in 50% effort only to finish the project on budget. But if the team starts working at 50%, then we go to on budget. But working at current pace, we are under budget, which will be 76.92, which is EAC. So TCPI should be calculated first! to be sure of how good the team is doing on daily basis.

# Key Focus Areas

Scope - Features, boundaries, budget, deadlines
Schedule - Duration, Sequence, Start, End, Sequence
Cost - Estimating, allocating, monitoring, action now and later
Quality - Process and Activities to meet objectives. Customer and Stakeholder requirement 
Resource - Carry our task in best manner. People, equipment, funds, facilities, other
Stakeholder - Project team, manager, sponsor, customer, users
Communication - To decrease probability of risk, among all stakeholders
Risk - First identify. Affects project, people, technology, processes, resource, +ve or -ve
Procurement - Material and services needed. Need to purchase, rent or contract
Critical Success Factors - Scoring based on KPI (learn more, not exact)
Deliverables - Has defined scope. Can be one or more. Often items sent externally.
Work Breakdown - Divide tasks into smaller components, makes tasks independent and manageble
