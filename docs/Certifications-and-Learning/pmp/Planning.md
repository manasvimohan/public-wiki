# Fundamentals
Determine scope, cost and resources
Identifications of Problems
Stakeholder's Identification
Define project objectives

# Why
Reduce cost and time
Increase employee satisfaction
Improve quality assurance
Reduce project risks

# Tools

CPM - Critical Path Method
PERT Chart
WBS - Work Breakdown Structure
Project Documentation

# Steps in project planning
Identify and meet stakeholder
Define Scope
Set and Prioritize objectives
Determine Deliverables
Create Project Schedule

## Project Time Management

Also Schedule Management Plan

### Key activities
Identify Activities
Estimating Time and Resources
Sequencing Activities

### Key Terms
Leads and Lags
Rolling Wave Planning - near goals are detailed, far goals have high level view only
Analogous Estimating - estimations based on previous projects or activities
Parametric Estimating - Mathematical model to calculate projected times
Effort - Total amount of work required to complete activity
Duration - Time required to complete an activity

### Project Schedule
Duration, start and end
Microsoft Project used most often

Gantt Chart
Network Diagram https://youtu.be/1gP839Y3sJQ?t=4310
    PDM - Precedence Diagramming Model OR AON - Activity on Node
        Box are activities, arrow dependencies, four types of relationships
    ADM - Arrow Diagramming Model or AOA Activity on Arrow
        Arrows are activities, direction indicate relation and sequence, only 1 relationship

# PERT --> Program Evaluation and Review Technique

https://youtu.be/1gP839Y3sJQ?t=5797

Uses three point estimate for the duration an activity will take
P - Pessimistic - worst case scenario
M - Most Likely - realistic scenario
O - Optimistic  - best case scenario 

Expect concept based questions, hence note the FORMULA, see the link above
