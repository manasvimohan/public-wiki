# Critical Path Method

Critical path is the longest duration path through a network diagram, which determines the shortest time to complete the project.

Float, also called as slack is calculated in a network diagram.

Three types of floats/ slack

The amount of time that a scheduled activity can be delayed or extended

1. Total Float - without delaying project finish date or schedule constrains
2. Free Float - without delaying any successor start date activity
3. Independent Float - All predecessors finish latest and All successors started earliest.

# Calculation of Float

Identify the critical path of the network
Follow the forward pass to find early start and early finish for each activity
Calculate late finish and late start using backward pass method


## Forward Pass

ES - Early Start
EF - Early Finish


## Backward Pass

LF - Late Finish
LS - Late Start

Total Float = LS - ES or Total Flaot = LF - EF

## Techniques and impacts
Fast Track - Adds risk, increase management time
Crash - Adds costs, increase management time
Reduce Scope - Saves time and cost, increase customer dissatisfaction
Cut quality - Saves cost and resources, increase risk
Resource Reallocation - Does not add cost or increase risk
