# ES6

[Refer Code Here](./code/01-OOP-example.js)

Before ES6 we need to use prototypes and setting them and all. Now all that has been made simple.
Syntactical sugar has been added and we can use (still class is actually object) 
class, constructor, extends, super etc just like python

Everything is still object in javascript! lol
 
# Classes
class Circle {
    constructor(radius) {
        this.radius = radius
    }
    
    draw(){}    // Instance method, can be accesses only if instance is created.
    
    static parse(str){} // Static Method, can be accessed independently, without creating instance.
}

Circle.draw()                   // Does not work
Circle.parse('hello')           // Works ok

const c1 = new Circle(1)
c1.draw()                       // Works ok

## Hoisting
Refer the index page, better explanation is given. 

## Static Method
See the section "Classes"
We use static methods in classes to create utility functions.

## Strict Mode and This keyword
https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881370

// Case 1
c1.draw()               // Here this refers to c1 object

// Case 2
const draw = c1.draw
draw()                  // Here this refers to window object

To prevent case 2, we use 'use strict'; at the top of the code.
This way in second case, instead of pointing to the window object, this will point to undefined.

## Private Members
We need private properties and objects in OOP. How we do it in JavaScript?

Symbols - https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881369

```
const _radius = Symbol()    <-- create a Symbol for variable
const _draw   = Symbol()    <-- create another symbol for function

this[_radius] = radius      <-- inside constructor of class, define variable
[_draw](){}                 <-- inside constructor of class, define function
```

WeakMaps - https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881371

const _radius = new WeakMap()   <-- Define WeakMap for variable
const _move   = new WeakMap()   <-- Define WeakMap for function
_radius.set(this, radius)       <-- Use Set to set value
_radius.get(this)               <-- Use get to use the value
_move.set(this, () => {})       <-- Use Set to set function
NOTE: Always use arrow functions here, else the "this" value issues arise

We can use const privateProps = new WeakMap() and then add all variables and functions to the privateProps.

## Getter and Setters

```javascript
// Called Implementation Detail - https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881473
const _radius = new Weakmap();

// Called Public Interface - https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881473
class Circle {
    constructor(radius) {
        _radius.set(this, radius)
    }
    
    get radius() {}         // Simply use get
    
    set radius(value) {     // Simply use set and include custom errors
        if (value <= 0) throw new Error('invalid radius')
        _radius.set(this,value)
    }
}

const c = new Circle(1);

console.log(_radius.get(c)) // Note we can still use this to view the values.
// To prevent above, we take the class out to another file, and export the class.
// Using modularity, we can ensure none of private is visible to user
```

## Inheritance
In ES6, the following is all we need to do:

class Shape {move(){}, draw(){}}
class Circle extends Shape {constructor(.., ..){super(..)} curve(){}}
class Square extends Shape {corner(){}} // Note, constructor is not always needed

const c = circle()
const s = square()

## Method Overriding
https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881374

Notice super in constructor, in above section. 
super(variables)        <-- To get variables from parent use
super.function()        <-- To get function from parent use

# Tooling
We want to ensure our code for
* Maintainability
* Reuse
* Abstract

Hence modularity comes in.
Principle of cohesion is used, meaning similar things go together.

History:
Before ES6, in ES5 there was no definition of modules!!! LOL
Hence various syntax styles called module formats were defined
1. AMD - Asynchronous Module Definition - Used by Browser only
2. CommonJS - Used by Nodejs
3. UMD - Universal Module definition - Used by Browser and Nodejs
4. ES6 Modules

## CommonJS
Exporting multiple classes
module.exports.Circle = Circle
module.exports.Square = Square

Exporting single class
module.exports= Circle

Then in other file
const Circle = require('./path-to-file')

## ES6
export class ....
export default dclass .....

in other file
import {class} from "path-to-file"  <-- {} used for non default exports
import dclass from "path-to-file"   <-- No {} in case of default export

## ES6 Tooling
We need to compile the scripts into backward compatible js, so we use babel compiler and webpack

### Babel
https://codewithmosh.com/courses/310571/lectures/4881476
We can use babel cli to convert any js file to backward compatible. 
But if we have 100 js files in project, we need to use webpack.

### Webpack
