# Intro

There is a set of grammar that is common to all computer languages which is to be learned.

Aspects of Computer Programming analogous to human languages

1. Basic rules  - Like alphabets, grammar rules in normal language.
2. Logic        - Like creating sentences, and paragraphs.
3. Art          - Like creating content on specific topics.

# Basic Rules
* Primitive Types - string, numbers, type conversion, integers, floats, doubles, null, undefined, NaN
* Reference Types - objects, functions
* Operators - Comparison, Conditional, Ternary, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Non Boolean like falsy truthy 
* Control Flow - Short-circuit evaluation; Loops, Recursions; Break, Continue, Pass 
* Functions - Arguments, Key Word Arguments, Default Arguments, Scope, Anonymous
* Data Structures - Array(list), Hashmap (dictionary), tuples, sets, enums etc
* DS operations - packing, unpacking; enumerations, each, map, reduce; joining, splitting, filtering, mapping, reducing; looping; adding, removing, sorting, finding items; list comprehensions etc
* OOP - Class, Constructor, Methods, Static Methods, Private Methods, Attributes, Private members(abstraction), Getters, Setters, Method Overriding, Interfaces (abstract classes, protocol), Inheritance, Composition, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Duck Typing, Magic Methods like repr, print, comparison, eq, gt etc etc
* Exceptions Handling and debugging - try except; raising
* Other Extra - Date Formats, printing, user inputs, file IO, OS control
* Documenting and Commenting - doc string like

* Concurrency and Threading, Processes, Async
* Module handling and creation - remote repository
* Package Managers - remote repository
* Testing - TDD (Test Driven Development) - Unit, Integration and E2E (end to end); assert
* Finally Domain Specific Applications ... <-- here is where most people are, who are not from CS background, and learning from youtube

# Logic
All about learning Algorithims
Dynamic Programming
Greedy
Loops, if else and recursions

# Art
OOP
Functional programming
