# Tuples
https://codewithmosh.com/courses/417695/lectures/6781707

A read only list, that can not be changed.

Uses curve brackets like --> ()
List use --> []
Sets use --> {}

point = (1,2)   <-- this is the way to define
point = 1,2     <-- python treats as tuple

type(point) <-- see the type

point = (1,2) + (3,4)       <-- (1,2,3,4)
point = (1,2) * 3           <-- (1,2,1,2,1,2)

point = tuple([1,2])        <-- convert list [1,2] to tuple

point[0] [:2:2] <-- all list like ways to access stuff

packing and unpacking like list eg a,b = point
