# Objective
Learning the best way to code in python and make a foundation for myself to learn new languages in future in such a way that best practices are always followed.

# Overview
We learn:
1. OOP                      - Object oriented helps use design patterns and all
2. Docstring                - For documentation
3. Error Handling           - Every error should be handled
4. Testing                  - Each code must have tests
5. Linting and Formatting   - To be sure the code looks and formatted properly
6. Modules                  - Proper way to create modules, with __init__.py
7. Scripts                  - Proper way with if __name__ == '__main__' thingy

enum for custom data type
inheritance
composition etc

# Details
## __name__ == __main__ thingy

"name" gives the name of the module from which the function is run.
    Run say.py, the answer is always __main
    Run another.py, which imports say.py. This time it prints the script name, which is "say"
