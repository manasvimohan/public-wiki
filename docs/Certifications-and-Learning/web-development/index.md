# Status Codes in API
200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).
301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.
400: The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don’t send along the right data, among other things.
401: The server thinks you’re not authenticated. Many APIs require login ccredentials, so this happens when you don’t send the right credentials to access an API.
403: The resource you’re trying to access is forbidden: you don’t have the right perlessons to see it.
404: The resource you tried to access wasn’t found on the server.
503: The server is not ready to handle the request.

# Dissecting incredible experiances 
1. On the very first entry, an emotional connect should be established.
2. Engage with all senses at once, which includes:
    1. See      <-- Visuals and animations, aesthetics | composition | color science.
    2. Hear     <-- Interactive sounds | background music for mood. Refer Japanese Anime and how they use insect, cooking sounds everywhere.
    3. Touch    <-- Pseudo feel of touch, giving material look, which can be felt, like neu morphism.
    4. Smell    <-- Pseudo feel of smell, a visual person smelling a dish, animation kind or thing. Like Disney.
    5. Taste    <-- Pseudo taste, an edible item animated, with materials which looks consumable.
3. Incorporate "Enhance-Escape" capturing style:
    1. Enhance, Magnify, Supplementary, in sync: Add on more emotion to what they already feel. Control though GPS, time, season etc. Example: Its morning and you give bright experiences. At night give relaxation, sexual drive feelings. Geo location near pub, party, give them energetic designs and sounds.
    3. Escape, opposite, complimentary: People are in some situation but emotional want the opposite. Control though GPS, time, season. Example. A person in cold area, give warm experience in design. A person in africa, give them cool design. A person in dessert, give fluid water design.

# Website development workflow and checklist inspired by spirituality and life
1. Start with writing a story, with story telling principles. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XGUVkOmPTA
2. Create structure with sections and subsections in the website, app.
3. Let people navigate based on their pseudo free will but with forced guide. Here people feel they are taking decision but actually the control is in our hands to the end climax.
4. JavaScript - Mouse cursor events, scroll events, hover events, time events, weather events, location events, tracking interactions and actions on the website. These drive animations, colors, sounds, compositions, navigation and routes.
5. Take compete control of experiance, yet make them feel free and in charge.
