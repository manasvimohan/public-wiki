One main class
One Interface, called strategy.
The classes with different method implementation.

NOTE:
State Pattern: Action is same in main class, mouse down up, but does different things.
Iterator Pattern: Action is same in main class, but the way data is handled/ iterated is different in back end.
Strategy Pattern: Action is different in main class, and calling of different actions done from the main class through interface based classes.
