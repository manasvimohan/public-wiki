Primarily uses inheritance from Abstract Classes. (Not Interface!)

We create abstract class, with all compulsory methods, which should be present in every instance of child.

Since its abstract class, it can have some specific methods defined already, unlike interface, where only method name is present.
Now concrete classes are made from abstract class.
Since these are created from abstract classes, one can over ride the base methods if needed, else can be kept as it is.

The methods defined in abstract class are called HOOKS.
