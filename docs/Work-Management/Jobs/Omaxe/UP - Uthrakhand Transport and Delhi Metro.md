Utrakhand - https://www.utconline.uk.gov.in/Home.aspx#buspasses
UP - http://uptransport.upsdc.gov.in/en-us/

Ideas:
* Insurance service
* Travel reward points
* Travel Hotel Restaurant integration
* OYO like quality assurance
* TaaS - Transport as a Service; for people to invest. Raising capital:
    * Includes adding buses
    * Trading goods through extra space etc
    * Traveller can buy for higher price to get returns on the seat, and get back investment in 6 months.
* Advertisement platform like facebook with bidding end to end:
    * Buses, Stations, Passes
    * Traveller profiling, login with fb, google:
        * Providing them options to buy sell stuff on bus and app and study behaviour
        * See travel patterns and suggest.
* Electric and Hydrogen Bus
* Send me an Item service, and integration with BORZO like service to let people send stuff interstate at lower cost.

Agro business seems to be the dream for large land base for 12000 Acre land idea
    - Tea business example
    - Apple takes 8 years to give apple, we farm them and sell tree which reap immediately.

Old people stays idea

## What they are did, doing and open to do
Tried - Freight, but operational heavy, want to try again.
Tried - Advertisement, but not good proposals, a modern solution is welcomed
Tried - Insurance, but not want to do as it is already adjusted in tickets with some internal mechanisms

Pilot - AI based head count system for exact travels - Can be integrated into advertisement
Pilot - AI based rash driving system to reduce maintenance, service quality and safety
Pilot - Diesel adulteration checking system

In Progress - Diesel bus conversion to CNG - Better than buying new ones

Early thoughts
    Electric buses consideration, but the battery disposal and change needs to be worked out. The cost offset vs 12 year life of electric and diesel is 8 years replacement.

Welcomed Solution. The pitch style which will allow you to do anything.
    Every n years, m amount of buses replaced with new ones. But no Transport Org ever has money for that at that time. If we can pitch into any solution, saying we can offset/ guarantee this amount, any authority will agree.
    Say, I will give the buses free every year, you let me do this x business.
    Example, I give land, create your business, dont give less or no rent, just give free buses. 


# Ideas

## How we approach solution

The feel:
* Ideas can be old, tried and failed, OR not tried and not worth....OR we want to, but never got the time...
* How we pitch a product in the market is the REAL GAME.

The perspective:
Transport is first point of contact for any person going to any destination. Leverage this opportunity, and monetize the purpose.
Movement can be monetized:
    Charging people per trip for fuel - Ancient and basic - we all do it
    Use unused spaces for freight - nothing new, operationally a bit cumbersome maybe
    AI data collection of roads, to be sold to Motor companies for AI training of autonomous driving cars - now you see what we mean
    
Freight         yes - Using a cargo space for micro deliveries
Insurances      no  - Baggage and Accidental Insurance
Advertisements  yes - Advertisement solutions
Tourist bus pass for 3 days - 500 Local - 700 AC
20% straight discount on 500+ hotels with our gold card
