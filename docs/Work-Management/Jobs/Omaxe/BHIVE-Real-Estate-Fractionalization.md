# Steps to take to start our own
Its is recommended to understand BHIVE business before this, please refer the next section if needed.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

1. Have 5-10 properties listed by us for Property/ Business Owners:
    1. Video Tour.
    2. Presentation Deck with photos, and business vitals.
2. Have 2-3 product choices for investors. Example I can think of:
    1. Short tenure, less return
    2. Long tenure, more return
3. Web/ Android and IOS app for investors:
    1. Time - 3-5 weeks. 
    2. Cost - Appx 10L +/- 2L.
4. Payment Partner:
    1. Time - 2-5 Days
    2. Cost - None, just the subscription fee of the provider
5. No app for Property Owners, just a support by our team:
    1. Internal team of Omaxe is ok to start with

We can roll out MVP in a month, provided:
1. We can have 5-10 properties docket prepared (video tour, photos etc), and listing approval.
2. At least 12L Funds ready for creating apps.

## Dividing the Plan of Action in 3 steps
1. Our Domain expertise
2. Strategy
3. Technology Architecture

### Our Domain Expertise
1. Shortlist properties of interest in various regions. For Omaxe or Non Omaxe properties.
2. Come up with attractive yet simple products, like RBF, AL and FRE in BHIVE. We must think of more, and surely we must be having more, based on our collective experience.
3. Legal contracts templates for client-property relationship.
4. Suit of services backing up platform:
    1. maybe betogether.in - Trusted and safe contracts
    2. maybe propcheck.in  - Trusted high quality
    3. similar to JLL - For trusted property management
    4. You get the point.

### Strategy
#### Clients Types
1. Property owner (PO):
    1. Partner / on boarded (PO1)
    2. Potential / not on boarded (PO2)
2. Investor (I)
3. Programmers (P) - A strategy fast growing business take.

#### Marketing Communication PRIME FOCUS
1. PO- Raise investment fast and secure way. List them "instantly", aim for zero TAT. Legally supported.
2. I - Filter, find, visualise returns (induce a dream of return) instantly. Induce being RE investor is the best business.
3. P - Build derived products from our system APIs. Like build platform to visualise returns on map. Build AI platform to project forecast of RE growth comparing states or countries. Build a secondary market for people want to exit before tenure closure. You get the point?

#### Monitization FOCUS:
1. First investment percentage cut.
2. ROI percentage cut.
3. Pre Mature investor exit, percentage cut.
4. Programmers system API and service charges.
5. Premium quality listing checklist service and support. (Like OYO does for hotels)
6. Traffic analysis on listings of PO1, and approaching near by PO2 properties.

#### Future Extensibility, beyond Real Estate
1. Opening platform for Cat 1 Big-Business like Pubs, Banquet Halls and Restaurants.
2. Opening platform for Cat 2 Mid-Business, like Chemist, Marts, Clothing.

Here Programmers can build on their own business and earn by

# About BHIVE

* Website - https://bhivealts.ai/
* Backed by Nitin Kamath
* Problem Statement/ Business Opportunity - https://bhivealts.ai/why-cre/

## 3 Products offered
They offer RBF, AL and FRE (FRE feels like an afterthought)

RBF - Revenue Based Financing
    * Invest in the BUSINESS of the real estate property.
    * Share revenue of that company.
    * Variable monthly payout.
    
AL  - Asset Lending
    * Invest in the REAL ESTATE itself in fraction.
    * Share rental of the property.
    * Stable monthly payout.
 
FRE - Fractionalized Real Estate
    * Not very clear on what it is, and how its different from AL.
    * It seems, AL is branded by BHIVE WHILE FRE is not BRANDED by BHIVE.
    * Please refer observations to understand what is meant.
    * Sharing rental of pre-leased property.
    * Monthly - but not clearly stated.
    
## Observations
What they are doing, but not explicitly telling:
1. Leasing out a property, at their level.
2. Build a commercial workspace or office or business around it.
3. Brand it as BHIVE property/ business.
4. Create RBF and AL for each property.
5. Payout investors based on the product they choose.
6. For the properties they do not brand under BHIVE, they put it under FRE.

AND
1. We can see BHIVE going on the path to be WeWork type of business. 
2. Their backend fractionalizing system gives rise to FRE product for others. Not the other way around. 
3. Hence it seems like RE fractionalizing company. But in real, they are using fractionalisation to create their own brand in real estate.

KEY NOTE - 
* For a particular property, they create RBF and AL both, and customer can choose either of the two or both. 
* For FRE products, they using EOI method (Expression of Interest). Before buying a slot, first book it with a refundable advance.
* Investor can not exit directly before tenure expiry, only option is to pass it on to another investor in the secondary market, which I could not find on their platform.

## Our potential edge and improvements
1. Focus on FRE rather than branding something our own, and then AL, for fast penetration.
2. UX/UI is bad. A lot of improvements.
3. They are missing EASY filtering of listings, which is a must these days.
4. Brand communication is also weak. Not easy to understand.
5. Our wide-spread presence and brand value is much better compared to having Nitin Kamath part of BHIVE.
6. Their penetration is slow, since they create a business first (which is a good strategy, but slow).

# Other details
## How relation of investor and property owner established
LLP or Partnership Agreement with each investor.

## Listings checklist
* A dedicated page for each property listing:
    * A single property has two listings, RBF and AL in case of BHIVE branded business
    * For non BHIVE branded business, they do not have a dedicated page.
* Call to action - Which takes to contact us page.
* Real video showing properties and 3d tour for pre-launch.
* Property presentation deck - With numbers, photos, why and all etc.
