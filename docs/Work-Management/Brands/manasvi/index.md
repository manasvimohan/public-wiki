# Thoughts
## The Story
### Core Emotion to convey 
Learn about me, from me, I am your friend, I help you and we thrive together.

### Aura
Spiritual and connected; to explore.

### Structure
Heading --> Je m'appele Manasvi. (I am called Manasvi) 
Pop up--> No I do not know french, but its fascinating how french introduce themselves. 
It seems enlightenment is build into the language itself.

Spirituality has this concept of singularity; That we all are one and there is no distinction or boundaries between matter as such. Hence the word "I" (which is the only word and alphabet at the same time) does not have any place in spirituality; quick note: many places in India use "We" to represent the individual self and do not use "I".

French use, Appeler (to be called) instead of Ãªtre (to be) to tell there name; they don't say, "My name is" or "I am", they say "I am called". It seems they know they are not the word, they are only referenced by it.

Understanding of the limitations in languages to incorporate the spiritual energy is quite evident.

THEME --> I have felt, at every nook and corner or life, my journey in the game of life taught me
Sections:
1. Life is Uncertain. Navigation --> mojs matterjs physics model can be used to give buttons, they break.
2. Concious effort is needed to take any action, in order to find anything.   <-- p5 to scratch and find about me.
3. If something comes without effort, they do not get our attention. About me.<-- CSS focus style, only hover
4. Interests are generated, and they go much deeper in layers, Projects.      <-- z-index pop up
5. We all are one, look fragmented and separated, but in the spiritual dimension are one. Contact me <-- Flying letters.
