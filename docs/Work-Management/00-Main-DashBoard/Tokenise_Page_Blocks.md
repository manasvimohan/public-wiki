# Tokenise page blocks

Idea is to create a product, which will 
1. Allow customers to put in blocks in their website as iframe or other mechanism.
2. In those blocks we will show advertisements from our backend while:
    1. Tracking Customer home page
    2. Views and clicks
    3. Type of customer website
3. Then analytics are created based on how many websites have our box placed and how much views the website gets.
4. Each block is tokenised and sold to interested people who want to partner.
5. The platform can have a token which can be listed.
6. We show analytics and ask adv agencies to pay us to put ads. 
7. The revenue gets distributed to the token holders as another coin OR in FIAT money if needed.
8. We keep 50% of tokens on platform and have only limited supply of token.

What is needed?

Boxes of different sizes eg
1. Banner size
2. Side bars
3. Inline bars
4. Boxes and circles

Calculations?

Assume 2 websites, w1 and w2
w1 has 100 views per day
w2 has 1000 views per day

Our boxes have, 100+1000 views per day. So to customer, we show 1100 views per day.
Assume view rate/ price set by us is $0.01
Total cost to customer --> 0.01 * 1100 per day = $11

To Website owners       --> 50% --> $5.5
To Product Stakeholders --> 50% --> $5.5

w1 gets 5.5 * 100/1100  = $0.5
w2 gets 5.5 * 1000/1100 = $5

Assume platform owns 30% of total tokens
Platform gets    --> 5.5 * 0.3     = $1.65
Stakeholders get --> 5.5 * (1-0.3) = $3.85

Assume 10,000 NFT based tokenisation


W1 is type tech
W2 is type food
W3 is type realestate
