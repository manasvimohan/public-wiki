# Youtube streaming graphics

Idea is to create templates of awesome graphics
    Its like putting in webcam part, other intro outrow graphics, full page webcam and put in blocks.
Then allow youtubers to create their videos within the template
In the framework attach the [Tokenise_Page_Blocks](Tokenise_Page_Blocks.md) blocks
Youtuber needs to put the link in description to allow them to be paid.


This is a weird idea; but could be done.
