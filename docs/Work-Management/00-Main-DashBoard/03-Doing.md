# To do now

I have 100s of things to do.
Some things get started.
Then they are left incomplete because I start a new thing.
This creates a chain of taking up new things, and the things I was doing gets lost.
To make sure I complete things before taking up new things, I have created this method.

> Note: Here I do not put in any sub pages, this is simply a checklist

# Method
Write down things to do next in the below section.
Set day of setting task. Note, no end date, as this has to be done now!
Mark checklist complete.
Move it to completed section, with the day it was completed.
