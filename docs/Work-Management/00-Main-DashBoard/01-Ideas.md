# Literature

## Little Ideas
1. Small images showing what THAT is, like upanishad of images
2. Small conversation or story to describe THAT
3. Carl Jung Archtypes

## Write experience of a objects.
Describe what tree feels like.
What if human had no eyes or ears or legs...but same brain. then what.

## The idea of "THAT", which was there all along, from dark space, to human and now experience in 1000000 years.

Long ago, only hot earth.
Then things cooled down, we get water and other compounds.
Then we see first single cells organisms feeding on elements.
Then we see their combinations, forming many perm/ combination or multi cell orgs feeding on elements.
Then we see larger organisms from multi cells organism per/ combination.
This continues like a exponential function, where things getting advance faster with every new abstraction.
What is it that wants to come out??? out of the dark empty space???
THAT thing tried to escape by being a dinosour, what was a dead end, then THAT tried again
Every new plant or animal like a dead end of a MAZE, THAT is running through the MAZE.
Running is the combination, activity, development, passing of time.
Every step is a creation of one specie in a way.
THAT was always there, in dark empty infintite space, omnipresent, actually no concept of present.

A person tied by chains and cloth and thick blanket, saffocating, wants to get out.
Step by step he gets out, runs through the maze, becomes species, fails like dinosours
Then tries again, abstraction over abstraction, development over development
Trying our skin, 5 eyes, 100 eyes, 10 ears, no ears, trying out all combinations.

THAT is at present HUMAN. The collective human. THAT can now know and experience better.
Development is still exponential, towards infinity at present, all happens with in.

Who are the remaining species? They are residuals of what THAT was, so he keeps them for later reference.
Rejects the ones that where of no use to THAT.

It took 1000000000000+ years for hot earth to form out of nothing.
It took 1000000+ years from hot earth to first single cell
then 1000 for multicell, then 100 extra for larger spicies then 10......etc....

See the time mentioned are for example, point is, 

For THAT, Every next advancement, is leap forward, taking shorter time, like exponential.
So presently, its taking 500 years for every leap, which is very fast.
There will come a time, every day, there will be a leap.

By leap I mean, the increase in complexity, a conclusion that this is final direction in maze,
Like I have decided this is the path.

News Archive - Take photo from 10 sites, and put in a calender
    Firebase pubsub to run every 15 min
    Puppeteer to scrap screenshot and heading
    Firebase cloud storage

Predictions - Take data from kaggle, ML model and visualise
    Add to big query
    then online jupyter notebook like datalab
    
Google Map MMO - Make a game eg GeoGuesser is a game
    Google map api
    Firebase realtime using FireStore
    Update game with cloud functions on Firabase
    
Make people allow chatting or video talk or texting based on GPS location, anonymously
    Firebase auth to get user togethor
    Twillio connection with a number to bridge them
    Both sides do not come to know the number of other
    Using GPS data to check proximity

Pricing data of various cloud services like aws azure google salesforce
    Basically get prices from api of each or scrap it
    Visualise it and privide to end-user
    Even historical can be seen
    
Sub Apps for big platforms like slack, discord, zerodha or telegram
    Can use zerodha to let people trade in groups and let the owner to exectute trade for everyone!


# Enable Affiliate link and multilevel selling for every brick and mortar brand
There are affiliate links on amazon to track who has done sales.
Imagine a system, where any store, anything, any reference to any product or market or mall, is done through that system, and a cut is shared.

# System for white labeling any brick and mortar store with a fee
Like a micro franchise or micro distributor.
It is somewhat like a RaaS (Restaurant as Service), but here we do not open a cloud kitchen, rather we ask already running business to allow us to sell their items, but under our name.

If I wish to sell a product from a bakery, under my whitelabel name, how can I do presently:
1. Talk to bakery for rights
2. Open an online shop on Dukaan or make your own website.
3. Promote it on instagram, google or personally
4. Take orders, buy from the bakery, give it to dukaan courier service.

IDEA - 
Make a platform, where any business can come, and allow people to sell their items in whitelabel way. Business can charge a % fee.

Then, connect it to the RaaS model, and let people create a cloud kitchen in 1 go.
