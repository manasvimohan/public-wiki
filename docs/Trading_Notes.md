## Rules to follow
### Overall strategy
1. Find out buyers stop losses and sellers stop losses in day start
2. Create an opinion on the direction for start, up or down.
3. Once market opens, continuously modify opinion based on candle sizes
	1. A few very long candles in 1 min chart indicates stop losses being hit
	2. Slow rise or fall on multiple small candles mean actual trading and mood
4. Keep checking which SL are being hit all day and take positions
5. Also, watching charts of the option contract is kind of useful, but keep things simple
6. Rainbow chart also can assist you once in trade, but do not exit based on it, do it only based on PL ratio
7. Do not enter or exit during large candles and movements; watch it and capture it. In case of loss, you should have exited earlier, but if caught in momentum, then exit on retracement, but with too much momentum, exit there.

### Entry
1. Based on the opinion, take a position, with PL ration of at least 20% (As per intraday hunter)
2. Exit on loss and exit on profit
3. You can take multiple trades, but try keeping things simple

### Holding
1. Keep holding profit over PL ratio as long as u-turn
2. Exit at loss exact based on PL ratio

### Exit
Inspired by Shakti from Conceptual Trader -https://www.youtube.com/c/ConceptualTrading
1. After entry, exit in 2-4 steps
2. For a good position, keep adding
3. For a bad position exit at PL ratio
