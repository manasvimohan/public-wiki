<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>
<p>If I am owner of UP-Utrakhand Transport, what technological advancements can be done to increase profits</p>
<p>Utrakhand - https://www.utconline.uk.gov.in/Home.aspx#buspasses
UP - http://uptransport.upsdc.gov.in/en-us/</p>
<p>Ideas:
* Insurance service
* Travel reward points
* Travel Hotel Restaurant integration
* OYO like quality assurance
* TaaS - Transport as a Service; for people to invest. Raising capital:
    * Includes adding buses
    * Trading goods through extra space etc
    * Traveller can buy for higher price to get returns on the seat, and get back investment in 6 months.
* Advertisement platform like facebook with bidding end to end:
    * Buses, Stations, Passes
    * Traveller profiling, login with fb, google:
        * Providing them options to buy sell stuff on bus and app and study behaviour
        * See travel patterns and suggest.
* Electric and Hydrogen Bus
* Send me an Item service, and integration with BORZO like service to let people send stuff interstate at lower cost.</p>
<h1 id="observations">Observations</h1>
<p>Total Buses         - 1400
Private Buses       - 300
Department owned    - 1100
Inter City qty      - 70% buses
Inter State qty     - 30% buses</p>
<p>Revenue city vs state ??
Volume  city vs state ??</p>
<p>50% revenue of Utrakhand is from manufacturing
Less than 15% from tourism -- Need to check</p>
<p>Agro business seems to be the dream for large land base for 12000 Acre land idea
    - Tea business example
    - Apple takes 8 years to give apple, we farm them and sell tree which reap immediately.</p>
<p>Old people stays idea</p>
<h2 id="what-they-are-did-doing-and-open-to-do">What they are did, doing and open to do</h2>
<p>Tried - Freight, but operational heavy, want to try again.
Tried - Advertisement, but not good proposals, a modern solution is welcomed
Tried - Insurance, but not want to do as it is already adjusted in tickets with some internal mechanisms</p>
<p>Pilot - AI based head count system for exact travels - Can be integrated into advertisement
Pilot - AI based rash driving system to reduce maintenance, service quality and safety
Pilot - Diesel adulteration checking system</p>
<p>In Progress - Diesel bus conversion to CNG - Better than buying new ones</p>
<p>Early thoughts
    Electric buses consideration, but the battery disposal and change needs to be worked out. The cost offset vs 12 year life of electric and diesel is 8 years replacement.</p>
<p>Welcomed Solution. The pitch style which will allow you to do anything.
    Every n years, m amount of buses replaced with new ones. But no Transport Org ever has money for that at that time. If we can pitch into any solution, saying we can offset/ guarantee this amount, any authority will agree.
    Say, I will give the buses free every year, you let me do this x business.
    Example, I give land, create your business, dont give less or no rent, just give free buses. </p>
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<h2 id="how-we-approach-solution">How we approach solution</h2>
<p>The feel:
* Ideas can be old, tried and failed, OR not tried and not worth....OR we want to, but never got the time...
* How we pitch a product in the market is the REAL GAME.</p>
<p>The perspective:
Transport is first point of contact for any person going to any destination. Leverage this opportunity, and monetize the purpose.
Movement can be monetized:
    Charging people per trip for fuel - Ancient and basic - we all do it
    Use unused spaces for freight - nothing new, operationally a bit cumbersome maybe
    AI data collection of roads, to be sold to Motor companies for AI training of autonomous driving cars - now you see what we mean</p>
<p>Freight         yes - Using a cargo space for micro deliveries
Insurances      no  - Baggage and Accidental Insurance
Advertisements  yes - Advertisement solutions
Tourist bus pass for 3 days - 500 Local - 700 AC
20% straight discount on 500+ hotels with our gold card</p>
<p>Transport Extension - Service Expansion proposal for remote and unreachable places - intra city commutes
    Electric Cycle 3 days subscription
    Motorcycle n days subscription
    Gram Sewa Integration
    Auto-Rickshaw Integrations
    Taxi Services Integrations
    Pick Drop from Home</p>
<p>Parkings are not just for food and waiting:
    High value, small footprint manufacturing and design - Screen guards, wall stickers, print on demand?
    2 hour rooms luxury rooms
    Japan like rest cubes, sleep for 3 hours in AC and TV.</p>
<p>Tourist Life Cycle Monetisation - Complex and Dynamic Package combo for a trip
    Stays       - Private hotels to get listed
    Food        - Restaurant discount coupons
    Activities  - Rafting, tracking, yoga discount coupons

    Site Seeing - Temple and Spots coupons
    Merchandise - Taking away memory
    Sharing Experience - Rented DSLR, personal photographer and movie maker
    Socialise   - Meetings people of same interests on the go</p>
<p>High Mobility, low cost Solutions - the young and foreigner choice
    Fractionalised stays for getting fresh
    Heavy baggage storage solution
    Extented living solution - Stay here and other place, but share the same 12 hour cost</p>
<p>Journey Time Monetization Infra - Motivation - Airlines menu AND Nariyal, Daal chat wala in bus and train.
    Travel Food Menu - Order items of choice. Delivered in 5 stops of journey
    Branded food delivery - Same, for dominos or mc donalds in 5 stops - Drone based delivery, maybe yes?
