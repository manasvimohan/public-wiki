<h2 id="the-idea-of-that-which-was-there-all-along-from-dark-space-to-human-and-now-experience-in-1000000-years">The idea of "THAT", which was there all along, from dark space, to human and now experience in 1000000 years.</h2>
<p>Long ago, only hot earth.
Then things cooled down, we get water and other compounds.
Then we see first single cells organisms feeding on elements.
Then we see their combinations, forming many perm/ combination or multi cell orgs feeding on elements.
Then we see larger organisms from multi cells organism per/ combination.
This continues like a exponential function, where things getting advance faster with every new abstraction.
What is it that wants to come out??? out of the dark empty space???
THAT thing tried to escape by being a dinosour, what was a dead end, then THAT tried again
Every new plant or animal like a dead end of a MAZE, THAT is running through the MAZE.
Running is the combination, activity, development, passing of time.
Every step is a creation of one specie in a way.
THAT was always there, in dark empty infintite space, omnipresent, actually no concept of present.</p>
<p>A person tied by chains and cloth and thick blanket, saffocating, wants to get out.
Step by step he gets out, runs through the maze, becomes species, fails like dinosours
Then tries again, abstraction over abstraction, development over development
Trying our skin, 5 eyes, 100 eyes, 10 ears, no ears, trying out all combinations.</p>
<p>THAT is at present HUMAN. The collective human. THAT can now know and experience better.
Development is still exponential, towards infinity at present, all happens with in.</p>
<p>Who are the remaining species? They are residuals of what THAT was, so he keeps them for later reference.
Rejects the ones that where of no use to THAT.</p>
<p>It took 1000000000000+ years for hot earth to form out of nothing.
It took 1000000+ years from hot earth to first single cell
then 1000 for multicell, then 100 extra for larger spicies then 10......etc....</p>
<p>See the time mentioned are for example, point is, </p>
<p>For THAT, Every next advancement, is leap forward, taking shorter time, like exponential.
So presently, its taking 500 years for every leap, which is very fast.
There will come a time, every day, there will be a leap.</p>
<p>By leap I mean, the increase in complexity, a conclusion that this is final direction in maze,
Like I have decided this is the path.</p>

<h1 id="system-for-white-labeling-any-brick-and-mortar-store-with-a-fee">System for white labeling any brick and mortar store with a fee</h1>
<p>Like a micro franchise or micro distributor.
It is somewhat like a RaaS (Restaurant as Service), but here we do not open a cloud kitchen, rather we ask already running business to allow us to sell their items, but under our name.</p>
<p>If I wish to sell a product from a bakery, under my whitelabel name, how can I do presently:
1. Talk to bakery for rights
2. Open an online shop on Dukaan or make your own website.
3. Promote it on instagram, google or personally
4. Take orders, buy from the bakery, give it to dukaan courier service.</p>
<p>IDEA - 
Make a platform, where any business can come, and allow people to sell their items in whitelabel way. Business can charge a % fee.</p>
<p>Then, connect it to the RaaS model, and let people create a cloud kitchen in 1 go.</p></div>
